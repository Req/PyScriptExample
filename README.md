# PyScriptExample

Work in progress for an example using `PyScript` to show a GUI and create some sound.

# Run

In order to run this example:

```
cd PyScriptExample
python3 -m http.server
Navigate browser to http://0.0.0.0:8000/
```

At the moment, the GUI is not really connected to the sound which should produce just some noise.
